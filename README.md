Files in assignment and lessons are referenced from https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html (Author: Ryan Abernathey, with significant contributions from Kerry Key, Tim Crone, and Julius Busecke) with slight modifications.


Answers to the assignments are done by Q.Yang. They do not explicitly answer all questions, but can serve as references.
